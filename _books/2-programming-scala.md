Dean is a well-known member of the Scala community, using Scala recently for streaming data systems at Lightbend and now at Domino Data Lab. This edition covers the new features of Scala 3, with comparisons to Scala 2, both to explain why the changes were made and how they improve Scala, and also to enable developers using mixed Scala 2 and 3 code bases to work effectively. The book is aimed at professional programmers who want a comprehensive, in-depth, yet pragmatic tour of Scala and best practices for using it.
